abstract = {Because hydride microstructure can significantly influence Zr alloy nuclear fuel cladding's ductility, a new metric has been developed to quantify hydride microstructure in 2D micrographs and relate it to crack propagation. As cladding failure usually results from a hoop stress, this new metric, called the Radial Hydride Continuous Path (RHCP), is based on quantifying the continuity of brittle hydride particles along the radial direction of the cladding tube. Compared to previous metrics, this approach more closely relates to the propensity of a crack to propagate radially through the cladding tube thickness. The RHCP takes into account hydride length, orientation, and connectivity to choose the optimal path for crack propagation through the cladding thickness. The RHCP can therefore be more closely linked to hydride embrittlement of the Zr alloy material, thus creating a relationship between material structure, properties, and performance. The new definition, along with previously proposed metrics such as the Radial Hydride Fraction (RHF), the Hydride Continuity Coefficient (HCC), and the Radial Hydride Continuity Factor (RHCF), have been implemented and automated in MATLAB. These codes are made available with this publication as supplementary materials. These metrics were verified by comparing their predictions of hydride morphology against expected values in simple cases, and the implementation of the new metric was validated by comparing its predictions with manual measurements of hydride microstructure performed on ImageJ. The RHCP was also validated against experimental measurements of fracture behavior and it was shown to correlate with cladding failure better than previous metrics. The information provided by these metrics will help accurately assess cladding integrity during operation, transportation, and storage.},

@article{Sharma2018,
abstract = {Pressure tube spools fabricated from Zr-2.5Nb alloy, were subjected to gaseous hydrogen charging and stress reorientation treatment to form radial hydrides in a specially designed fixture. Curved Compact Tension specimens of 17 mm width containing 100 wppm of hydrogen were made using electro discharge machining. Some of the samples were annealed at 300, 325 and 350 °C followed by furnace cooling. Metallographic examination of the samples revealed 100 radial hydride in the samples to which stress reorientation treatment was imparted. The radial hydride fraction decreased with increase in the temperature of annealing that followed stress reorientation. Fracture toughness of samples with variable radial hydride fraction was evaluated as per ASTM E1820-13 procedure between 25 and 300 °C. All the samples exhibited a sharp ductile to brittle transition behavior and the transition temperature was observed to increase with increase in the radial hydride fraction.},

abstract = {Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC) behaviour of Zr-2.5Nb Pressure Tube (PT) material used in Indian 200MWe Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) containing radial hydrides and circumferential hydrides was studied in the temperature range of 200–250 °C. A section of the PT was charged with 70wppm of hydrogen and successfully subjected to re-orientation treatment to form radial hydride. The radial hydride in the reoriented tube was characterised by the hydrogen continuity co-efficient (HCC). It was observed that the average DHC velocity (VDHC) for the radial hydrided sample was 2.5 and 1.85 times faster than the circumferential hydrided sample at 200 and 225 °C, respectively. The VDHC at the temperature of 250 °C, for both the radial hydrided and the circumferential hydrided sample were comparable. The average VDHC for circumferential hydrided sample varies linearly with 1/T while it was observed to vary non-linearly with 1/T for radial hydrided sample. The VDHC of the radial hydrided sample was observed to increase with increase in the stress intensity factor, whereas for circumferential hydrided samples the VDHC was independent of stress intensity factor in the range of 18–45MPa.m1/2.},
